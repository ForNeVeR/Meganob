A Word From the Original Author
-------------------------------
Most tools won't be useful to you because they are all
programmed in a hurry. Bad or even not documented at all,
only I know how to use them. (I hate them too, don't worry).
The game source might be of better use to you. It's fairly good
(however far from perfect) commented in the source.
Just have a look at it. I think if you want to learn to
programm graphics or sound you better have a look at some
specialized packages not this one.

Anyway, if you find this package useful send me a mail,
well even send me a mail if you don't find it useful at all.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
